# react-quizzical

Quizzical is a fun and educational application that allows users to test their knowledge and learn new information through an interactive quiz. Built on top of the Open Trivia database, the application presents users with a set of 5 random questions from various categories, such as science, history, geography, entertainment, and more.

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Upon launching the application, users are presented with a welcome screen. To start the quiz, users simply click on the "Start Quiz" button, and the application will randomly generate a set of 5 questions.

For each question, users are presented with a list of multiple-choice answers. If the user does not pick all answers to all five questions, they recieve a pop-up modal suggesting that they should pick answers for the remaining questions. At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with a summary of their score, feedback for each answer and the option to replay the quiz with a new set of questions.

The Quizzical application is built using the React framework.
